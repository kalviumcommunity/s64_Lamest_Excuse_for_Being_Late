# Project Title: Lamest Excuse for Being Late?

Project Overview:
This project will be a web-based platform where users can share their most creative, funny, or downright ridiculous excuses for being late to various events—whether it's work, school, or social gatherings. Users can submit their excuses, view others' submissions, and vote on the best (or lamest) excuses. The goal is to create an engaging and lighthearted community where people can laugh at the absurdity of these excuses, while also seeing how creative people can get under pressure.

Key Features:

User Registration & Login: Users will be able to create an account, log in, and participate in the community.
Submit Excuses: Users can submit their excuses for being late, along with an option to add categories (work, school, appointments, etc.).
Vote on Excuses: Other users can upvote or downvote excuses to determine the lamest, funniest, or most creative.
Categories & Tags: Excuses can be categorized and tagged, making it easy for users to find excuses that are relevant to specific situations.
Leaderboard: Display the most upvoted excuses, showing the top 5 lamest excuses of the week/month.
Comment Section: Users can comment on each excuse to share their thoughts or suggest even worse excuses.
Search & Filter Options: A search bar that allows users to filter excuses based on tags, categories, and voting status (upvoted, downvoted).
Responsive Design: The app will be fully responsive, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Tech Stack:

Frontend:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Vanilla JS or React for the frontend framework)
Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for responsive design and UI components
Axios for API calls
Backend:

Node.js with Express for server-side logic
MongoDB for storing user data, excuses, votes, and comments
JWT for authentication (secure login/logout)
Hosting:

Frontend: GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel
Backend: Heroku or DigitalOcean
Database: MongoDB Atlas
Why This Project:
This project will allow me to combine both frontend and backend development skills, creating a full-stack web application. I’ll have the opportunity to work with modern web technologies (React, Node.js, MongoDB), and focus on implementing user-driven features like voting systems and categories. It’s also a fun, creative, and engaging project that can attract a lot of users who enjoy light-hearted content. By working on this project, I’ll develop my skills in web design, user interaction, and managing server-side logic, while also learning about real-world web application deployment and hosting.
